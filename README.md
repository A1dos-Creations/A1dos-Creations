- âœ¨ What am I working on? - I'm working on a HUGE update for SPL. I'm adding several new features, along with a nice subtle rebranding. This update will include several features that take SPL's capabilities to the moon!ðŸŒ•

- ðŸš€ What are my goals? - One of my new years resolutions was to code atleast once a day, and I'm trying to keep true to that!
