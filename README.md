- âœ¨ What am I working on? - Currently I'm, working on adding accounts for STL and my main website [a1dos-creations.com](https://a1dos-creations.com/).
    - These accounts will **allow users to sync their tasks across devices and manage their preferences**! This feature will be free to all users, however, it isn't to me! Databases need space, and space costs money. STL collects no money, so I ask of you to [donate $1](https://paypal.me/a1dos?country.x=US&locale.x=en_US). You obviously don't have to donate, but it helps keep STL alive!


- ðŸš€ What are my goals? - My main goal is to make school a bit easier for students. I've had problems getting to school portals and tools, with my new extension, those problems go away! My goal is to erradicate any unnecessary hassle in the school enviroment (online, that is).
